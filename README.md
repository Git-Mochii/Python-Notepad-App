# Python-Notepad-App

This is a Notepad application I created with Python using the "Tkinter" import.

The note application has 4 main features that are compiled into simple buttons. The window is not resizable to prevent bugs and clipping issues with different resolutions, the application is confined to a size of 600x600. 
To exit the app, a user must simply click on the 'X' button on the top right of the screen. For the application to load previous notes, the JSON file must be downloaded and stored within the same folder as the Python file to avoid any path errors.

"Save Note"
- This button saves the content present within the main content box and title box
- The title will also now be displayed in the tab area where other notes can be accessed.

"Delete Note"
- This button deletes the current note displayed, it will delete its contents and the note cannot be restored after deletion.
- Before a user deletes a note, a prompt message will ask the user to confirm the action

"New Note"
- This button creates a new note that will contain an empty title and content box
- New notes appear with blank titles in the tabs area

"Load Notes"
- This button requires the JSON file to be installed and stored within the same folder as the Python file to function correctly
- This button allows a user to access previously saved notes in the tab bar, these notes can be edited again
